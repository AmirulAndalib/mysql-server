# The intent of this test is to verify if the validations that were
# created within the Group Replication plugin in the startup process
# are fully functional.
#
# It will test binlog disabled failure.
#
# Since the failure will happen when "START GROUP_REPLICATION" is
# issued, the test procedures are the following:
# - Install plugin at startup
# - Call START GROUP_REPLICATION and wait for it to fail
#

--source include/not_embedded.inc
--source include/have_innodb.inc

# The section below is present in "have_group_replication_plugin.inc."
# But since this test is evaluating the absence of certain configurations, one
# is not able to use that file since it enforces the existence of such
# parameters in the server.
