  @class Gcs_message

  Class that represents the data that is exchanged within a group. It is sent
  by a node having as destination the group. Thus,it is received by all members
  that pertain to the group in that moment.

  It is built using two major blocks: the header and the payload of the message.
  Each of the binding implementation will use these two fields at its own
  discretion.

  When the message is built, none of the data is passed unto it. One has to
  use the append_* methods in order to append data. Calling encode() at the end
  will provide a ready-to-send message.

  On the receiver side, one shall use decode() in order to have the header and
  the payload restored in the original message fields.
