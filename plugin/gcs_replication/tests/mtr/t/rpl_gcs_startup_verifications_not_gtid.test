# The intent of this test is to verify if the validations that were
# created within the GCS plugin in the startup process
# are fully functional.
#
# It will test the static variables:
# - gtid_mode. It will be set to OFF in order to fail.
#
# Since the failure will happen when "START GCS_REPLICATION" is
# issued, the test procedures are the following:
# - Install plugin
# - Call START GCS_REPLICATION and wait for it to fail
