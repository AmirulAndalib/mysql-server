# WL#7660 - GCS PLUGIN IMPLEMENTATION
#
# This test checks the basic functionality of the GCS replication
# plugin which should work with the .opt file in which the GCS
# replication options are passed as options.
# Synchronous replication will work only for RBR mode of replication so this
# test is restricted to this mode only.
